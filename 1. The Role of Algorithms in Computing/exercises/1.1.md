**1.1-1**
Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that re-
quires computing a convex hull

- calculation of diameter of the set of points

**1.1-2**
Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world
setting?

- memory

**1.1-3**
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and
limitations.

- Hash table (dictionary in Python)
pros: random allocation in memory => const O(1) search time
cons: possible collision caused by chaining

**1.1-4**
How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
How are they different?

- similar: minimum distance
- diff: shortest-path solved, salesman - NP problem, e.g. approximation

**1.1-5**
Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then
come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good
enough.

- finding the best location for food chain restaurant, based on people concentration and traffic
- finding the best incline angle of the space shuttle during start, depending of physical limitaions (start mass, weather conditions)  of the action
